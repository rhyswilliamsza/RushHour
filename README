According to our project spec, RushHour is a game consists of a collection of cars of varying sizes,
set either horizontally or vertically, on a NxM grid that has a single exit.

The purpose of the game is to get a red car to the exit, by moving the other cars out of the way.

There are two methods of game play. If two program arguments are given,
the program will use the file provided by the second argument as a 'solutions' file.
Otherwise, the program will endeavour to solve the puzzle using a 'SolverManager' class.

Program arguments.
    First, Board File.
    Second, not required, Solutions file.
    Amend:   -v for visual,
             -c for counter

To check all board files systematically:
